JavaCompiler Project
========

This is a Compiler project developed as a practical examination of Compiler's subject at UFCG.

We decided to use both JFlex and CUP.

For further information about those tools, you could check the [JFlex](http://jflex.de/) and [CUP](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/CUP/) official websites.

To build the project:
	* Make sure you have [Apache ANT](http://ant.apache.org/) installed
	* Run ant generate
